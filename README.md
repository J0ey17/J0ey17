Congratulations on finding this section, Just me rambling on about my love "Computer Networking"
I love Computer Networking. Learning about services, protocols, packets from the ground up is like sandwiches for my brain and I have a lot of sandwiches yet to eat!! 
How they come all together to make this beautiful thing call Internet really broadens my perspective. Just think about it, everywhere in the World, some service is running correctly, protocols are being followed, packets are being delivered due to which the entire Internet is working. It is something, isn't it??
This is why I got into Cyber Security. I get to study the stuff, and then I get to break the stuff.
And Breaking the stuff is where adrenaline starts pumping in my brain! I live for the moments when I get a shell, or a exploit starts working after hours of debugging.
